# IMISE classicthesis Vorlage
Fancy LaTeX template for Bachelor and Master theses at IMISE based on the [classicthesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) package.
The package is perfectly suited for PhD theses as well but there may be some adaptations needed as I don't know the requirements of the Pr√ºfungsamt.
Using this template is optional and suggested for those who value aesthetics and typography and don't mind a little complexity.
If you want to use a less complicated template, use https://github.com/IMISE/imise-latex.

## Language
Can be used for both English and German. German is set by default. To switch to English, rename the sections and change the babel language.
